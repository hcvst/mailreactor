WHY MAILREACTOR
===============

Mailreactor is a simple email forwarding service I built to allow my clients to
start using email with their newly registered domains quickly. Well, at least I
thought it would be simple, until I realized I would have to cater for SPF and 
SRS.

Thank you Spammers for the extra effort caused - at least SPF is interesting 
unlike your garbage. Shame on you.

The mailreactor site offers a pay as you go email service. I felt that new 
domain owners would probably want to use email asap. At least the first time I
registered a domain, I was eager to impress my friends with my own email 
address quickly. However, I didn't feel I could afford to offer free email 
services, so instead I built this backend, the mailreactor site to configure 
forwarding rules and gave every new domain owner some free credits to have fun 
with.

    hostname VARCHAR(512),
    ip VARCHAR(512),
    sender_address VARCHAR(512),
    timestamp DATE
);
CREATE TABLE email_alias(
